  Automate yield, protect liquidity, and power next-gen creator ecosystems with programmable Uniswap v4 Hooks and EigenLayer restaking.

  OVERVIEW:

TomoLabs transforms passive swap fees into active, auto-compounding yield by routing Uniswap v4 pool fees directly into Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) strategies through a fully on-chain Yield Hook. Built on top of Uniswap v4 Hooks, EigenLayer restaking, and modular fee routers, TomoLabs enables MEV-protected trading, creator-owned liquidity, programmable yield distribution, and autonomous revenue flows across the decentralized economy.

  CORE PRINCIPLES:

1.) Trustless Debt Settlement:
All group expenses, member balances, and repayments are enforced entirely by smart contracts, eliminating reliance on off-chain trust, manual accounting, or centralized intermediaries.

2.) Automated Fee-to-Debt Conversion:
Swap fees captured via Uniswap v4 Hooks are automatically routed into the Splitwise contract, converting passive trading activity into real-time debt repayments without user intervention.

3.) Composable DeFi Integration:
The system is natively composable with Uniswap v4 and EigenLayer-based restaking flows, enabling Splitwise to plug directly into permissionless liquidity, yield, and restaking infrastructure.

4.) Non-Custodial & Permissioned Control:
Users retain full control of their funds at all times, while sensitive repayment automation is strictly permissioned to the registered hook, preventing unauthorized fund movement.

5.) Transparent, On-Chain Accountability:
Every expense, repayment, and auto-settlement action is emitted as on-chain events, enabling block explorers, DAOs, and analytics tools to verify all financial flows in real time.
