  Automate yield, protect liquidity, and power next-gen creator ecosystems with programmable Uniswap v4 Hooks and EigenLayer restaking.

  OVERVIEW:

TomoLabs transforms passive swap fees into active, auto-compounding yield by routing Uniswap v4 pool fees directly into Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) strategies through a fully on-chain Yield Hook. Built on top of Uniswap v4 Hooks, EigenLayer restaking, and modular fee routers, TomoLabs enables MEV-protected trading, creator-owned liquidity, programmable yield distribution, and autonomous revenue flows across the decentralized economy.
